  1. The #1 Priority: Build an "Engagement Engine"

  Exponential growth on social media is driven by interaction. Your bot currently only posts; it doesn't engage. We
  can change that.

   * What it is: A feature where the bot actively engages with other users.
   * How it works:
       * Reply to Mentions: When someone replies to your bot's "engaging question" or asks it a question, we can use
         the Gemini LLM to generate a relevant, in-character reply. This makes the account feel alive and encourages
         more people to interact.
       * Like and Retweet: The bot could search for popular tweets within its niches (e.g., #history, #python) and
         intelligently Like or Retweet them. This would put your account in front of thousands of people who are
         already interested in your topics.

  2. Add AI-Generated Visuals

  Tweets with images get dramatically more engagement than text-only tweets.

   * What it is: Automatically generate a unique, relevant image for certain types of posts.
   * How it works: For topics like "History Fact," "Deep Thought," or "Tech," we can add a step where the bot sends a
     prompt to an AI image generation model (like the one built into Gemini). It would then attach the generated image
      to the tweet. Imagine a history fact about the Roman Empire accompanied by a stunning, AI-generated image of a
     Roman legion.

  3. Create High-Value Twitter Threads

  A single tweet is fleeting, but a well-written thread can provide immense value, be saved, and be shared widely.

   * What it is: A new content type where the bot creates a "tweetstorm" (a series of connected tweets) on a single
     topic.
   * How it works: We could create a new topic like "deep_dive". The prompt would instruct the LLM to break down a
     complex subject (e.g., "How does a CPU work?" or "The key ideas of Stoicism") into a 3-5 tweet thread. I would
     then modify the post_tweet function to post the tweets as replies to each other, creating a thread.
